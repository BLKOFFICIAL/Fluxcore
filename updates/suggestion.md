# Suggestion System Documentation

## Introduction

The suggestion system for our Discord bot allows users to submit suggestions for improvements, new features, or changes to the server. This documentation outlines how to use the `/suggest` command to submit suggestions and the `/set-suggestchannel` command to configure the suggestion submission channel.

## Commands

### `/suggest`

The `/suggest` command is used to submit a suggestion to the server. Follow the steps below to use this command:

1. Type `/suggest [your suggestion]` in the desired text channel.
2. Replace `[your suggestion]` with the actual suggestion you want to submit.
3. Press Enter to send the command.

Example:
```/suggest Add a music bot to the server for sharing music playlists.```


The bot will then post your suggestion in the configured suggestion submission channel for review.

### `/set-suggestchannel`

The `/set-suggestchannel` command is used to configure the channel where suggestions should be submitted. Follow the steps below to use this command:

1. Type `/set-suggestchannel #channel` in the text channel where you want to set up the suggestion submission channel.
2. Replace `#channel` with the desired channel mention (e.g., #suggestions) where suggestions should be posted.
3. Press Enter to send the command.

Example:
```/set-suggestchannel #suggestion-box```


The bot will update the suggestion submission channel to the specified channel, and all future suggestions will be posted there.

## Guidelines for Suggestions

When submitting suggestions, please keep the following guidelines in mind:

- Make sure your suggestion is clear and concise.
- Check if a similar suggestion has already been submitted before.
- Avoid suggesting content that violates the server's rules or guidelines.
- Be respectful and constructive in your suggestions.

## Conclusion

The suggestion system is designed to gather input from the community and improve our server and bot. Use the `/suggest` command to share your ideas, and the `/set-suggestchannel` command to set up the suggestion submission channel. We value your input and look forward to seeing your suggestions!
